            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Henna Marie Suan Barcebal, and Iâ€™m a second-year student at the University of the Immaculate Conception in Davao City, 
                where Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
                I was born and raised in Cotabato City, and have come to Davao City to continue my education. 
                As the eldest of four siblings and the only daughter, my family plays a significant role in my life. 
                My father works as a farmer, and my mother is a high school teacher. 
                Growing up with them has instilled in me a strong sense of perseverance and a commitment to learning. 
                Iâ€™m guided by the motto, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. 
                In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths." â€” Proverbs 3:5-6, 
                which inspires me to face lifeâ€™s challenges with faith and determination.

                In this section, Iâ€™ve curated a selection of my favorite things that offer a glimpse into my personality and passions. 
                Each photo is a reflection of what I enjoy and value, from hobbies to personal moments. 
                I hope these images provide a bit more insight into who I am and what brings me joy.

                    These hobbies allow me to channel my emotions and ideas into visual forms. Through colors and shapes,
